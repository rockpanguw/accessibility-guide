When we create many Python scripts, the data folder, and the log folder, we add more complexity to the folder structure. Have a .md file that tells students what these scripts are doing as well as clear expectations (i.e., the Colab coding questions) of the activity. You can find the question.md file in my GitHub screenshot. We usually have the students submit the homework Colab assignment on canvas or Gradescope. It is much easier for BVI students to submit their answers on the .md file, instead of having to navigate multiple web platforms. 2. Add Loggings. We also recommend adding loggings to your computational notebooks and the Python scripts. This will be helpful for students to debug their code. When you have a print statement, you should also log these statements to a log folder. This is important for students with visual impairment to debug their code. When you print a lot of statements in the terminal, you cannot easily scroll up or copy-and-paste the terminal output for screen reader users. To log your output, please use the logging package and refer to this blog post. 3. Below is an example of logging in Python. Note that we use logger.info to log the output. We include clear documentation of the question, housekeeping information, and step 1. The output is logged to ./log/section_1.log. We also include an estimated running time for the key step. This is important for students with visual impairment to understand how long it takes to run the code, or they simply run into glitch in the server. # Question 1: How many titles of each type are in the IMDB dataset? # Keywords: Dataframe API, SQL, group by, sort # check ./log/section_1.log for the output # Load libraries import pyspark, logging from pyspark.sql import * from pyspark.sql.functions import * ## Housekeeping: setup code to read intermediate datasets def script_filter(record): if record.name != __name__: return False return True handler = logging.StreamHandler() handler.filters = [script_filter] logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) logger.addHandler(handler) fh = logging.FileHandler('./log/section_1.log', \"w+\") # write to file logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) logger.addHandler(fh) # Create a SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"4g\").getOrCreate() # Load the datasets Titles = spark.read.csv(\"data/title.basics.tsv\", sep='\\t', header=True) Principals = spark.read.csv(\"data/title.principals.tsv\", sep='\\t', header=True) ## End of Housekeeping. # This is the description in Google Colab as well. # Step 1: IMDB lists many different kinds of media -- movies, video games, TV episodes, etc. Let's group the IMDB titles by titleType and count how many records exist belonging to each title type: # The estimated running time is &lt; 1 sec. title_type_counts = Titles.groupBy(\"titleType\") \\ .agg(count(\"*\").alias(\"numTitles\")) \\ .sort(desc(\"numTitles\")) # Log the output logger.info(\"Step 1: {}\".format(title_type_counts)) .

However, PDF files are not often accessible to screen reader users. One solution is to accessible Markdown files, which is a small text to HTML conversion language with the goal of making writing formatted text in a plain text editor easier. Notably, Markdown is accessible to screen reader users and can be easily converted to PDF files too. One convenient way is to maintain a central Markdown file, which can be converted to a PDF file using pandoc. The benefit is that screen readers work with PDF files, especially when combined with Mathjax for math notation: . pandoc --toc --standalone --mathjax -f markdown -t html YOUR_HOMEWORK_FOLDER/*.md -o YOUR_HTML_NAME.html --metadata title=“HOMEWORK_TITLE\" . | pandoc is open-source document converter software.

When you finish addressing the reading order for all slides, make sure to go back to Review → Check Accessibility to see if any warnings are reported.

    "content": "To understand common accessibility barriers in class, you should read the Common Accessibility Barriers in Classrooms, which outlines issues such as PowerPoint Slides, computational notebooks, homework assignments. Then, we recommend reviewing the specific sections while you are working on the corresponding election of your class. We also encourage you to show the students examples of your course materials, and specify the tools that may be used for homeworks before they take the class, to identify any remaining barriers early. This document focuses on students with visual impairments. here are many students with a range of disabilities, with a variety of access needs who may require accommodations to succeed in higher education courses. We highly recommend contacting Disability Resources for Students (DRS) at the earliest possible based on your students’ access needs. Note that many campuses’ disability offices are extremely overworked, therefore, we also suggest you give this document a read before reaching out for further questions. In creating this document, we consulted with Disability Resources for Students and received valuable feedback from Esteban Safranchik, Ken Gu, and Katharina Reinecke. If you have comments, please reach out to Rock Yuren Pang and Tim Althoff (ypang2@cs.washington.edu and althoff@cs.washington.edu). We also welcome additional feedback to improve this document. ",

While you can certainly add detailed text description in your alt text, you can augment your flowchart with a Mermaid representation. Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code. It is especially beneficial to augment flowcharts. BVI students will “compile” the Mermaid declarative grammar themselves. What we are doing here is transforming graph structure in a declarative format so that screenreaders can interact with them. Here is the URL to the Mermaid documentation and the URL to an online playground. Let’s look at an example: . | We show an image from an original PowerPoint slide. First let’s change the color contrast: | . | We will add the Mermaid diagram. You can also look at the image that Mermaid compiles A Mermaid-compiled flowchart. | . ",

This will be helpful for all students to make sense of the notebook and especially helpful to prepare accessible content. 1. Check the table of contents. Check the table of contents on your Colab left bar. Make sure each section has a clear title and description. 2. Divide the Colab Document into Separate Python Scripts. A good guide to organize your Colab notebook is to divide it into separate Python scripts. Migrate the sections into separate Python scripts. The goal here is that screen reader users can work on the modular script for each section. You might realize that we created a separate data folder in the github directory compared to drive = GoogleDrive(gauth) which is unique to Google Colab. Make sure that you share your data file (e.g., Google Drive) so that everyone can have access to it. 3. Run the notebook to make sure everything works. Always to run the notebook before releasing the homework. Also, host your notebook on a shared environment that can be tested by the course staff ahead of time since library incompatibilities etc. can present significant barriers to students. ",
