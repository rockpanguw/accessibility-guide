# Accessibility Guide for Classes at UW CSE
{: .fs-9 }

---

This document gives an overview for instructors and TAs to improve course accessibility for students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI). Whether you don’t know where to start, or want to double-check whether any accessibility concerns may have been missed around your materials, we hope that this document will help you. 

We believe that increasing accessibility makes the course more approachable to all students, though it requires time and effort. This guide will help you make materials accessible more efficiently.

## How to use this document
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

To understand common accessibility barriers in class, you should read the [Common Accessibility Barriers in Classrooms]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/introduction/common_barriers), which outlines issues such as PowerPoint Slides, computational notebooks, homework assignments. Then, we recommend reviewing the specific sections while you are working on the corresponding election of your class.

We also encourage you to show the students examples of your course materials, and specify the tools that may be used for homeworks before they take the class, to identify any remaining barriers early. 

This document focuses on students with visual impairments. here are many  students with a range of disabilities, with a variety of access needs who may require accommodations to succeed in higher education courses. We highly recommend contacting Disability Resources for Students (DRS) at the earliest possible based on your students’ access needs. Note that many campuses’ disability offices are extremely overworked, therefore, we also suggest you give this document a read before reaching out for further questions.

In creating this document, we consulted with Disability Resources for Students and received valuable feedback from Esteban Safranchik, Ken Gu, and Katharina Reinecke. If you have comments, please reach out to Rock Yuren Pang and Tim Althoff (ypang2@cs.washington.edu and althoff@cs.washington.edu). We also welcome additional feedback to improve this document.
