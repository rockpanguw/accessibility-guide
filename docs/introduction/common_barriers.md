## PowerPoint Slides: 
Imagine a blind student trying to understand matrix multiplication in a highly animated PowerPoint slide. The image of a  matrix that you animated happened to be a screenshot from a textbook. Under that scenario, sighted students can easily understand the transformation with the engaging slide, but blind students will likely be completely lost. 

A key takeaway to making PowerPoint slides is not to completely rely on visual cues. You should always consider adding alt text to images, animations, and math notations. If visual cues are important, you can consider augmenting the experience with tactile graphics (braille).

## Computational notebook software, such as Google Colab: 
make it easier to collaborate and share code. However, screen reader users cannot access and work with these notebooks, as of this writing. 

To make computational notebooks more accessible, you can easily create separate Python files for each section of your notebook. Additionally, blind users may not be able to create visualizations as homework deliverables. Instead, you can consider having them present the information in an alternate format to test the correctness (e.g., a data table).
 
## Document assignments: 
PDFs are often inaccessible to people using screen readers by default. We recommend releasing the Markdown and LaTeX files whenever possible. It is easy to use pandoc convert a Markdown/LaTeX file with math notations to an accessible HTML file supported by MathJax, which works with screen readers (see section 4). 

## In-class activities: 
In-class discussions are often accessible by default if they donâ€™t heavily rely on a visual component. However, if your in-class activity needs to focus on a visual element (e.g., discussing the drawbacks between k-means and hierarchical clustering), it helps if you can provide tactile graphics. The Disability Resources for Students can help create these from images and slides.

## Group project: 
It helps to talk with the students ahead of time to understand what accommodations they might need for a project. In team-based projects, sometimes students like to focus on a certain part of the project, e.g., literature review, giving presentations, or writing, instead of more inaccessible elements (e.g., analyzing visualizations). 

Now that you have a high-level understanding of where you may encounter accessibility issues in your  class, the next few sections are going to expand on each point and guide you through concrete steps to make them more accessible.
