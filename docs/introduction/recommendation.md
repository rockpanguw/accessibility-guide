Here are high-level recommendations on how to proceed in a class to improve accessibility for BLV students.

## Communicate before the quarter. 

To accommodate the needs for different students, we recommend communicating with the students before the quarter. Ask them if they need additional accommodations like accessible PowerPoint and coding/homework setup. 

## Communicate with DRS. 

You should communicate with the DRS if this document doesn’t cover specific needs from students. Also it’s helpful to print out necessary braille materials in the beginning of the quarter. The DRS is helpful and the turnaround is usually within 2 weeks. 

## Make the accessible slides publicly 

Make the accessible slides publicly available on the course website so that all students have the chance to preview the slides if they would like to. Share the accessible materials (e.g., braille) with the students 1 week before the class session.

## Test the server before launching homework or colab activities. 

Before releasing the homework or colab on a server, please test that the code can run on the server without configuration issues. Configuration issues can be significant overhead burdens to BVI students. Any unexpected configuration errors can significantly hurt student’s confidence to succeed in the class. 

## Always adjust needs for individual students. 

Note that each student might have different access needs, and preferences to navigate accessibility barriers. Please discuss with them throughout the course for feedback.
