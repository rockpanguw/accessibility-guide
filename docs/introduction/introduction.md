This document gives an overview for instructors and TAs to improve course accessibility for students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI). Whether you donâ€™t know where to start, or want to double-check whether any accessibility concerns may have been missed around your materials, we hope that this document will help you. 

We believe that increasing accessibility makes the course more approachable to all students, though it requires time and effort. This guide will help you make materials accessible more efficiently.
